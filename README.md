# (School project) Implementation of own Splay tree and own hash table using chaining method. AVL tree and Hash table with Linear Probing where taken from Internet. Sources are at the top of the .c files.
<h1>Splay tree</h1>
I have implemented Splay Tree using pointer to the parent note instead of using recursion. Every time node is inserted or searched for, it becomes root of the tree.
<h1>Hash Table - Chaining</h1>
For implementation of Hash Table I have used Linked list with resizing based on Prime numbers.
